          "Taken as a whole, Rousseau&#8217;s writings attacked the Age of Reason, gave impetus to the Romantic movement by emphasizing feeling (leading Goethe to say that &#8220;feeling is all&#8221;), revived religion even though he had doubts about some traditional teachings, provided a new direction for education (his book <i>&#201;mile</i> since Plato&#8217;s <i>Republic</i>), inspired the French Revolution, made a unique impact on political philosophy, and, more than the writing <p align=\"center\">of any of his contemporaries, influenced</p> <p align=\"left\">several subsequent philosophers, especially</p> <p align=\"right\">Immanuel Kant. On one occasion, Kant was</p> so absorbed in reading Rousseau&#8217;s <i>&#201;mile</i> that he forgot to take his celebrated daily walk While <span>Kant</span> admitted that it was David Hume who awakened him from his dogmatic slumbers regarding the theory of knowledge, it was <p>example: <sup>superscript text</sup></p> <sub>subscript text</sub> Rousseau who <br/>showed him the way to a new theory of <br />morality. So impressed was Kant by the insights <br > of Rousseau that he hung a picture of him on <br> the wall of his study, convinced that Rousseau <p>was</p> the Newton of the moral world. This is an odd place for a math example, but here's a LaTeX example: When $a \\ne 0$, there are two solutions to \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) and they are $$x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}.$$ and here's a MathML example: <math><msqrt><mn>2</mn></msqrt></math> and here's a base64 inline image example: <img src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAUAAAAFCAYAAACNbyblAAAAHE+lEQVQI12P4//8/w38GIAXDIBKE0DHxgljNBAAO9TXL0Y4OHwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" />"

          "The roses we lay at Rousseau&#8217;s feet for this theory of Natural Rights tend to overwhelm the less fragrant of his ideas. He persisted in believing in the nobility of the primitive state of nature, and that women&#8217;s nature was to serve men. His assertions about Natural Rights of Man laid the philosophical foundation of American independence, but his worship of emotion over reason and of &#8220;negative education&#8221; gave generations of parents permission to ignore the need to discipline and teach their children."
